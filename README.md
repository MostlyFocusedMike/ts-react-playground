## TypeScript hooks guide
Here's [a good article on hooks and TS](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/usetypescript-a-complete-guide-to-react-hooks-and-typescript-db1858d1fb9c)

## Whats tsconfig "esModuleInterop" do?
It lets us import things how we normally would, not

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { useState, useContext } from 'react';

// to the usual:
import React, { useState, useContext } from 'react';
```
heres is a [stackOverflow that explains it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54674392/react-with-typescript-how-to-import-methods), and a [snippet from the docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-7.html#support-for-import-d-from-cjs-from-commonjs-modules-with---esmoduleinterop)

## what is postcss and astroturf
postcss lets you put css in js files, and astroturf is the recommended webpack loader.
[for install](https://github.com/postcss/postcss#css-in-js)
You also need to update vscode to handle it with an extension, i'm currently using postcss-sugarss-language

## getting annoying json import error to go away
by adding

```js
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
```

you can now import json just like you would normally with js, HOWEVER Vscode won't stop
highlighting the error in a test file since those are skipped from the build. so you had to
use // @ts-ignore above the json test import to get it to stop, see the stackoverflow for the [oroginal proof](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52296956/vscode-typescript-importing-json-file-highlighting-issue)

## Why can't I destructure default imports?


```js
const thing = {
    a: 'A',
}

export default thing

import { a } from './constants';
```

this would fair to do with babel, but not anymore. we're mixing commonJS (require, module.exports) destructuring behavior, and es6 (import, export).
There are technical reasons, check them out in their fuller explanations:
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33505992/babel-6-changes-how-it-exports-default/33506169#33506169
- https://kentcdodds.com/blog/misunderstanding-es6-modules-upgrading-babel-tears-and-a-solution
  - specifically thig blog

Also, this is not to be confused with `import React, { useState }`, or `import { thing }`, React is the default export, and useState is just an export

```js
// I think this is roughly:

const React = thingsss

const useState = other stuff

export default React

export useState
```
That's the pattern you can use to get both default and regular exports

## typescript cheat sheet

## warnings about act()
Really not 100% sure why this goes away, but use an
        const { getByText, debug, findByText} = setup();
        await waitForElement(() => getByText('test1')); // waitForElement seems to take care of this problem
